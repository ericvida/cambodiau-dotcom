	[	# Story 1 - The Creation
		`0 1st Story, The Creation`
		`1 This is how God made everything in the beginning. He created the universe and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was dark and empty, because he had not yet formed anything in it. But God's Spirit was there over the water.`
		`2 Then God said, “Let there be light!” And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it “day.” He separated it from the darkness, which he called “night.” God created the light on the first day of creation.`
		`3 On the second day of creation, God said: “Let there be an expanse above the waters.” And there was an expanse. God called this expanse “sky.”`
		`4 On the third day, God said: “Let the water come together in one place and the dry land appear.” He called the dry land “earth,” and he called the water “seas.” God saw that what he had created was good.`
		`5 Then God said, “Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants.” And that is what happened. God saw that what he had created was good.`
		`6 On the fourth day of creation, God said: “Let there be lights in the sky.” And the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years. God saw that what he had created was good.`
		`7 On the fifth day, God said: “Let living things fill the waters, and birds fly in the sky.” This is how he made everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and he blessed them.`
		`8 On the sixth day of creation, God said, “Let there be all kinds of land animals!” And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good.`
		`9 Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will rule over the earth and all the animals.”`
		`10 So God took some soil, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a large garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.`
		`11 In the middle of the garden, God planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.`
		`12 Then God said, “It is not good for man to be alone.” But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.`
		`13 So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.`
		`14 When Adam saw her, he said, “At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man.” This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.`
		`15 God made man and woman in his own image. He blessed them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was very good,¬ and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of creation.`
		`16 When the seventh day came, God had finished all the work that he had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day he stopped creating things. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.`
	],[ # Story 2 - The Fall of Mankind
		`0 2nd Story, The first sin of mankind`
		`1 Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any shame because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.`
		`2 But there was a snake in the garden. He was very crafty. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?”`
		`3 The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, 'If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.'” `
		`4 The snake responded to the woman, “That is not true! You will not die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does.”`
		`5 The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it too.`
		`6 Suddenly, their eyes were opened and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.`
		`7 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked. So I hid.”`
		`8 Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”`
		`9 God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat soil. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other too. The woman's descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”`
		`10 God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire to control your husband, and he will rule over you.”`
		`11 God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard for your food. When you die, your body will return to soil.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life-giver,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.`
		`12 Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the garden. God placed powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.`
	],[ # Story 3 - The Flood
		`0 3rd story - The flood of the whole earth.`
		`1 After a long time, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It became so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.`
		`2 But God was pleased with Noah. He was a righteous man living among wicked people. God told Noah that he was going to make a big flood. Therefore, he told Noah to build a huge boat.`
		`3 God told Noah to make the boat about one hundred and forty meters long, twenty three meters wide, and thirteen and a half meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.`
		`4 Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the flood that was coming and told them to turn to God, but they did not believe him.`
		`5 God also commanded Noah and his family to gather enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.`
		`6 God sent a male and a female of every kind of animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every kind of animal that could be used for sacrifices. When they were all in the boat, God himself closed the door.`
		`7 Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for 40 days and 40 nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.`
		`8 Everything that lived on the dry land died except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept everything inside the boat safe from drowning.`
		`9 After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then, one day, the boat rested on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.`
		`10 After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.`
		`11 Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!`
		`12 Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it found a place to rest outside of the boat and did not come back. The water was drying up!`
		`13 Two months later, God said to Noah, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth.” So Noah and his family came out of the boat.`
		`14 After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal that could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.`
		`15 God said, “I promise I will never again curse the ground because of the evil things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though people are sinful from the time they are children.”`
		`16 God then made the first rainbow as a sign of his promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what he promised and so would his people.`
	],[ # Story 4 - God's Covenant with Abraham (edited, transed, recorded)
		`0 4th Story - God's Covenant with Abraham`
		`1 Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they still sinned against God and each other. Because they all spoke the same language, they gathered together and built a city instead of spreading out over the earth as God had commanded.`
		`2 They were very proud, and they did not want to obey God's commands about how they should live. They even began building a tall tower that would reach heaven. God saw that, if they all kept working together to do evil, they could do many more sinful things.`
		`3 So God changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”`
		`4 Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All families on earth will be blessed because of you.”`
		`5 So Abram obeyed God. He took his wife, Sarai, together with all of his servants and everything he owned and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.`
		`6 When Abram arrived in Canaan, God said, “Look all around you. I will give to you all this land, and your descendants will always possess it.” Then Abram settled in the land.`
		`7 There was a man named Melchizedek who was a priest of God Most High. One day, after Abram had been in a battle, he and Abram met. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had won in the battle.`
		`8 Many years went by, but Abram and Sarai still did not have a son. God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God's promise. God declared that Abram was righteous because he believed in God's promise.`
		`9 Then God made a covenant with Abram. Normally, a covenant is an agreement between two parties to do things for each other. But in this case, only God made a promise to Abram. Abram was in a deep sleep, but Abram could still hear God. God said, “I will give you a son from your own body. I give the land of Canaan to your descendants.” But Abram still did not have a son.`
	],[ # Story 5 - The Son of Promise (edited, recorded)
		`0 - 5th Story - The Son God promised 0 - A Bible story from: Genesis 16-22`
		`1 Ten years after Abram and Sarai arrived in Canaan, they still did not have a child. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, "Since God has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my servant, Hagar. Marry her also so she can have a child for me."`
		`2 So Abram married Hagar. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him Ishmael. But Sarai became jealous of Hagar. When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again spoke to Abram.`
		`3 God said, "I am God Almighty. I will make a covenant with you." Then Abram bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, "You will be the father of many nations. I will give you and your descendants the land of Canaan as their possession and I will be their God forever. You must circumcise every male in your family."`
		`4 "Your wife, Sarai, will have a son—he will be the son of promise. Name him Isaac. I will make my covenant with him, and he will become a great nation. I will make Ishmael a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac." Then God changed Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many." God also changed Sarai's name to Sarah, which means "princess."`
		`5 That day Abraham circumcised all the males in his household. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.`
		`6 When Isaac was a young man, God tested Abraham's faith by saying, "Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me." Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to sacrifice his son.`
		`7 As Abraham and Isaac walked to the place of sacrifice, Isaac asked, "Father, we have wood for the sacrifice, but where is the lamb?" Abraham replied, "God will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son."`
		`8 When they reached the place of sacrifice, Abraham tied up his son Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was about to kill his son when God said, "Stop! Do not hurt the boy! Now I know that you fear me because you did not keep your only son from me."`
		`9 Nearby Abraham saw a ram that was stuck in a bush. God had provided the ram to be the sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.`
		`10 Then God said to Abraham, “Because you were willing to give me everything, even your only son, I promise to bless you. Your descendants will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you have obeyed me, I will bless all the families of the world through your family.”`
	],[ # Story 6 - God Provides for Isaac (Edited, recorded)
		`0 6th Story - God Provides for Isaac`
		`1 When Abraham was very old, his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man. So Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land where his relatives lived to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac.`
		`2 After a very long journey to the land where Abraham's relatives lived, God led the servant to Rebekah. She was the granddaughter of Abraham's brother.`
		`3 Rebekah agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant to Isaac's home. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.`
		`4 After a long time, Abraham died. God then blessed Abraham's son, Isaac, because of the covenant he had made with Abraham. One of God's promises in that covenant was that Abraham would have countless descendants. But Isaac's wife, Rebekah, could not have children.`
		`5 Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were still in Rebekah's womb, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.`
		`6 God told Rebekah, “You will give birth to two sons. Their descendants will become two different nations. They will struggle with each other. But the nation coming from your older son will have to obey the nation coming from your younger son.”`
		`7 When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then the younger son came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob.`
	],[ # Story 7 - God Blesses Jacob (seen by Eric, Katiet, Joshua)
		`0 7th Story - God Blesses Jacob `
		`1 As the both boys grew up, Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt animals. Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau.`
		`2 One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Please give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, promise me that everything you should receive because you were born first, you will give it all to me.” So Esau promised to give to Jacob all those things. Then Jacob gave him some food.`
		`3 Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau's clothes and put goatskins on his neck and hands.`
		`4 Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau. I have come so that you can bless me.” When Isaac touched the goat hair and smelled the clothes, Isaac thought Jacob was Esau and blessed him.`
		`5 Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also stole his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.`
		`6 But Rebekah heard of Esau's plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.`
		`7 Jacob lived with Rebekah's relatives for many years. During that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.`
		`8 After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.`
		`9 Jacob thought Esau still wanted to kill him , and he was very afraid. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “Your servant, Jacob, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”`
		`10 But Esau no longer wanted to harm Jacob. Instead, he was very happy to see him again. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham now passed on from Isaac to Jacob.`
	],[ # Story 8 - God Saves Joseph & His Family (eric, katiet, joshua)
		`0 8th Story - God Saves Joseph & His Family`
		`1 Many years later, when Jacob was an old man, he sent his favorite son, Joseph, to check on his brothers who were taking care of the flocks.`
		`2 Joseph's brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had dreamed that he would be their ruler. When Joseph came to his brothers, they kidnapped him and sold him to some slave traders.`
		`3 Before Joseph's brothers returned home, they tore Joseph's robe and dipped it in goat's blood. Then they showed the robe to their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph. Jacob was very sad.`
		`4 The slave traders took Joseph to Egypt. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the Nile River. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy government official. Joseph served his master well, and God blessed Joseph.`
		`5 His master's wife tried to sleep with Joseph, but Joseph refused to sin against God in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph of doing wrong, so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph remained faithful to God, and God blessed him.`
		`6 After two years, Joseph was still in prison, even though he was innocent. One night, the Pharaoh, which is what the Egyptians called their kings, had two dreams that disturbed him greatly. None of his advisors could tell him the meaning of the dreams.`
		`7 God had given Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, “God will give seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of famine.”`
		`8 Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph that he appointed him to be the second most powerful man in all of Egypt!`
		`9 Joseph told the people to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of famine came so they would have enough to eat.`
		`10 The famine was severe not only in Egypt, but also in Canaan where Jacob and his family lived.`
		`11 So Jacob sent his ten oldest sons to Egypt to buy food. The brothers did not recognize Joseph when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.`
		`12 After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph said to them, “I am your brother, Joseph! Do not be afraid. You tried to do evil when you sold me as a slave, but God brough good from evil! Come and live in Egypt so I can provide for you and your families.”`
		`13 When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.`
		`14 Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt with all of his family, and they all lived there. Before Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons.`
		`15 The covenant promises that God gave to Abraham were passed on to Isaac, then to Jacob, and then to Jacob's twelve sons and their families. The descendants of the twelve sons became the twelve tribes of Israel.`
	],[ # Story 9 - God Calls Moses (edited, recorded)
		`0 9th Story - God Calls Moses`
		`1 After Joseph died, all of his relatives stayed in Egypt. They and their descendants continued to live there for many years and had many children. They were called the Israelites.`
		`2 After hundreds of years, the number of Israelites had become very large. The Egyptians were no longer grateful that Joseph had done so much to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the Pharaoh who was ruling Egypt at that time made the Israelites slaves to the Egyptians.`
		`3 The Egyptians forced the Israelites to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives miserable, but God blessed them, and they had even more children.`
		`4 Pharaoh saw that the Israelites were having many babies, so he ordered his people to kill all Israelite baby boys by throwing them into the Nile River.`
		`5 A certain Israelite woman gave birth to a baby boy. She and her husband hid the baby for as long as they could.`
		`6 When the boy's parents could no longer hide him, they put him in a floating basket among the reeds along the edge of the Nile River in order to save him from being killed. His older sister watched to see what would happen to him.`
		`7 A daughter of Pharaoh saw the basket and looked inside. When she saw the baby, she took him as her own son. She hired an Israelite woman to nurse him without realizing the woman was the baby's own mother. When the child was old enough that he no longer needed his mother's milk, she returned him to Pharaoh's daughter, who named him Moses.`
		`8 One day, when Moses had grown up, he saw an Egyptian beating an Israelite slave. Moses tried to save his fellow Israelite.`
		`9 When Moses thought nobody would see, he killed the Egyptian and buried his body. But someone saw what Moses had done.`
		`10 Pharaoh learned what Moses had done. He tried to kill him, but Moses fled from Egypt into the wilderness. Pharaoh's soldiers could not find him there.`
		`11 Moses became a shepherd in the wilderness far away from Egypt. He married a woman from that place and had two sons.`
		`12 Moses was taking care of his father-in-law's herd of sheep. One day, he saw a bush on fire, burning without being destroyed. He went close to the bush to look at it. When he was very close, God spoke to him. He said, “Moses, take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.”`
		`13 God said, “I have seen the suffering of my people. I will send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring the Israelites out Egypt, and no longer be slaves. I will give them the land of Canaan, the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”`
		`14 Moses asked, “What if the people want to know who sent me, what should I say?” God said, “I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, 'I AM has sent me to you.' Also tell them, 'I am Yahweh, the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' This is my name forever.”`
		`15 Moses was afraid and did not want to go to Pharaoh because he thought he could not speak well, so God sent Moses' brother, Aaron, to help him. `
	],[ # Story 10 - The Ten Plagues (edited, recorded)
		`0 10th story - The Ten Plagues`
		`1 God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be stubborn. When they went to Pharaoh, they said, "This is what the God of Israel says, 'Let my people go!'" But Pharaoh did not listen to them . Instead of letting the Israelites go free, he forced them to work even harder!`
		`2 Pharaoh kept refusing to let the people go, so God sent ten terrible plagues on Egypt. Through these  plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and all of Egypt's gods.`
		`3 God turned the Nile River into blood, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.`
		`4 God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh begged Moses to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites leave Egypt.`
		`5 So God sent a plague of lice. Then he sent a plague of flies. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them that if they stopped the plague, the Israelites could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from Egypt. But Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go free.`
		`6 Next, God caused all the farm animals that belonged to the Egyptians to get sick and die. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go.`
		`7 Then God told Moses to throw ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the Egyptians, but not on the Israelites. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.`
		`8 After that, God sent hail that destroyed most of the crops in Egypt and killed anybody who went outside. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them, "I have sinned. You may go." So Moses prayed, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.`
		`9 But Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart. He would not let the Israelites go free.`
		`10 So God caused swarms of locusts to come over Egypt. These locusts ate all the crops that the hail had not destroyed.`
		`11 Then God sent darkness that lasted for three days. It was so dark that the Egyptians could not leave their houses. But there was light where the Israelites lived.`
		`12 Even after these nine plagues, Pharaoh still refused to let the Israelites go free. Since Pharaoh would not listen, God planned to send one last plague. This would change Pharaoh's mind.`

		`2 God provided a way to save the firstborn son of anyone who believed in him. Each familyhad to choose a perfect lamb and kill it.`
		`3 God told the Israelites to put the blood of this lamb around the door of their houses. They should roast the meat. Then they should quickly eat it, along with unleavened bread. He also told them to be ready to leave Egypt immediately after they ate this meal.`
		`4 The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them to do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.`
		`5 All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so God passed over those houses. Everybody inside them was safe. They were saved because of the lamb's blood.`
		`6 But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands. So God did not pass over their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons.`
		`7 Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail to the firstborn of Pharaoh. Many people in Egypt were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.`
		`8 That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptian people also urged the Israelites to leave right away.`

		`0 12th Story - The departure from Egypt`
		`1 The Israelites were very happy to leave Egypt. They were no longer slaves, and they were going to the Promised Land! The Egyptians gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations believed in God and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.`
		`2 A tall pillar of cloud went ahead of them during the day. It became a tall pillar of fire at night. God, who was in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, was always with them and guided them as they traveled. All they had to do was follow him.`
		`3 After a short time, Pharaoh and his people changed their minds. They wanted to make the Israelites their slaves again. So they chased after the Israelites. God who made them change their minds. He did this because he wanted everyone to know that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and all the gods of the Egyptians.`
		`4 When the Israelites saw the Egyptian army coming, they realized they were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea. They were very afraid and cried out, “Why did we leave Egypt? We are going to die!”`
		`5 Moses told the Israelites, “Stop being afraid! God will fight for you today and save you.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the people to walk toward the Red Sea.”`
		`6 Then God moved the pillar of cloud and placed it between the Israelites and the Egyptians so the Egyptians could not see the Israelites.`
		`7 God told Moses to raise his hand over the sea. Then God caused the wind to push the water in the sea to the left and the right, so that there was a path through the sea.`
		`8 The Israelites marched through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on either side of them.`
		`9 Then God raised the cloud so that the Egyptians could see the Israelites escaping. The Egyptians decided to chase after them.`
		`10 So they followed the Israelites onto the path through the sea, but God caused the Egyptians to panic and caused their chariots to get stuck. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!”`
		`11 The Israelites all arrived at the other side of the sea. Then God told Moses to stretch out his hand again over the water. When Moses did that, the water fell on the Egyptian army and returned to its normal place. The whole Egyptian army drowned.`
		`12 When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they trusted in God. They believed that Moses was a prophet of God.`
		`13 The Israelites also rejoiced very much because God had saved them from dying and from being slaves. Now they were free to worship God and obey him. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom and to praise God because he saved them from the Egyptian army.`
		`14 God commanded the Israelites to celebrate a festival every year in order to remember how God had defeated the Egyptians and freed them from being slaves. This festival was called the Passover. In it, they had to celebrate by killing a healthy lamb, roasting it, and eating it with bread made without yeast.`

		`5 “Do not make idols and do not worship them, because I, Yahweh, must be your only God. Do not use my name in a disrespectful way. Be sure to keep the Sabbath day holy. In other words, do all your work in six days, for the seventh day is a day for you to rest and to remember me.”`
		`6 “Honor your father and your mother. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not covet your neighbors house, do not covet your neighbors wife, or other's male or female servants, kows, animals, or anything that belongs to him.”`
		`8 God also told the Israelites to make a large tent—the Tent of Meeting. He told them exactly how to make this tent and what things to put in it. He told them to make a large curtain to separate the tent into two rooms. God would come into the room behind the curtain and stay there. Only the high priest was allowed to go into that room where God was.`
		`9 The people must also make an altar in front of the Tent of Meeting. Anyone who had disobeyed God's law should bring an animal to that altar. A priest would then kill it and burn it on the altar as a sacrifice to God. God said that the animal's blood would cover that person's sin. In this way, God would not see that sin any longer. That person would become clean in God's sight. God chose Moses' brother, Aaron, and Aaron's descendants to be his priests.`
		`10 God wrote these Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to Moses. God also gave the people many other laws to bless and protect them.`
		`11 For many days, Moses remained on top of Mount Sinai. He was talking with God. But the people became tired of waiting for him to return to them. So they brought gold to Aaron and asked him to make an idol that they could worship instead of God. In this way, they sinned terribly against God.`
		`12 Aaron made a golden idol in the shape of a calf. The people began to wildly worship the idol and make sacrifices to it! God told Moses that he should destroy the people of Israel because of their sin, but Moses asked God to keep his promise with the people. God heard Moses, and turned his anger away from the people.`
		`13 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he was carrying the two stone tablets on which God had written the Ten Commandments. When Moses saw the idol, he became angry and he smashed the tablets.`
		`14 Then Moses burned the idol and ground it into powder. He threw the powder into a stream and made the people drink the water. God sent a plague on the people and many of them died.`
		`15 Moses made new stone tablets for the Ten Commandments to replace the ones that he had broken. Then he climbed the mountain again and prayed that God would forgive the people. God listened to Moses and forgave them. Moses came back down the mountain with the Ten Commandments on the new tablets. Then God led the Israelites away from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land.`

		`1 God finished telling the Israelites about all the laws that they must obey because of his covenant with them. After God gave his law to the people of Israel, Then he led them away from Mount Sinai. He wanted to take them to the Promised Land. This land was also called Canaan. God went ahead of them in the pillar of cloud, and they followed him.`
		`2 God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many people groups living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not worship or obey God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.`
		`3 God told the Israelites, “After you go into the Promised Land, you must get rid of all the Canaanites there. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not obey me, you will end up worshiping their idols instead of me.”`
		`4 When the Israelites reached the border of Canaan, Moses chose 12 men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.`
		`5 The twelve men traveled through Canaan for forty days, and then they came back. They told the people, “The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful!” But ten of the spies said, “The cities are very strong and the people are giants! If we attack them, they will certainly defeat us and kill us!”`
		`6 Immediately, Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”`
		`7 But the people did not listen to Caleb and Joshua. They became angry with Moses and Aaron and said, “Why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt. If we go into the land, we will die in battle, and the Canaanites will make our wives and children to be slaves.” The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.`
		`8 When the people said this, God came to the Tent of Meeting and said, “You have rebelled against me, so all of you will have to wander in the wilderness. Everyone who is 20 years or older will die there and never enter the land I am giving you. Only Joshua and Caleb will enter it.”`
		`9 When the people heard God say this, they were sorry they had sinned. So they decided to attack the people of Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God would not go with them, but they did not listen to him.`
		`10 God did not go with them into this battle, so the Canaanites defeated them and killed many of them. Then the Israelites turned back from Canaan. For the next 40 years, they would wander through the wilderness.`
		`11 During the 40 years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called manna. He also sent flocks of quail (which are medium-sized birds) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and sandals from wearing out.`
		`12 To provide them with water to drink, God miraculously made it come out of a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. Even so, God was still faithful. He did what he promised that he would do for the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.`
		`13 Another time when the people did not have any water, God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses did not speak to the rock. Instead, he hit the rock twice with a stick. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but moses dishonored God, and God said, “Because you did this, you will not enter the Promised Land.”`
		`14 After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, all of those who had rebelled against God were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so God chose Joshua to lead the people. God also promised Moses that one day he would send to the people another prophet like Moses.`
		`15 Then God told Moses to go to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for 30 days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.`

		`0 - 15th Story - The Promised Land - A Bible story from: Joshua 1-24`
		`1 At last it was time for the Israelites to enter Canaan, the Promised Land. In that land was a city called Jericho. It had strong walls around it to protect it. Joshua sent two spies to that city. In that city lived a prostitute named Rahab. She hid these spies, and later she helped them to escape from the city. She did this because she believed God. The spies promised to protect Rahab and her family when the Israelites would destroy Jericho.`
		`2 The Israelites had to cross the Jordan River to enter into the Promised Land. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests started to step into the Jordan River, the water upstream stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over to the other side of the river on dry ground.`
		`3 After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua to get ready to attack the city of Jericho, even though it was very strong. God told the people that their priests and soldiers must march around the city once a day for six days. So the priests and the soldiers did this.`
		`4 God also said that on the seventh day the Israelites must march around the city seven times. Then the priests must blow their trumpets and all the people must shout loudly. So they did this.`
		`5 Then the walls around Jericho fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city, as God had commanded. They only spared Rahab and her family, who became part of the Israelites. When the other people living in Canaan heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.`
		`6 God had commanded the Israelites not to make a peace treaty with any of the people groups in Canaan. But one of the Canaanite people groups, called the Gibeonites, lied to Joshua and said they were from a place far from Canaan. They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Joshua and the other leaders of the Israelites did not ask God what they should do. Instead, they made a peace treaty with the Gibeonites.`
		`7 Three days later, the Israelites found out that the Gibeonites really did live in Canaan. They were angry because the Gibeonites had deceived them. But they kept the peace treaty they had made with them because it was a promise before God. Then, some time later, the kings of another people group in Canaan, the Amorites, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.`
		`8 So Joshua gathered the Israelite army. They marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning, they surprised the Amorite armies and attacked them.`
		`9 God fought for Israel that day. He caused the Amorites to be confused and he sent large hailstones that killed many of the Amorites.`
		`10 God also caused the sun to stay in one place in the sky so that Israel would have enough time to completely defeat the Amorites. On that day, God won a great victory for Israel.`
		`11 After God defeated those armies, many of the other Canaanite people groups gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.`
		`12 After these battles, God gave each tribe of Israel its own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.`
		`13 When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua reminded the people that they had promised to obey the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai. The people promised to be faithful to God and obey his laws.`
	],[ # 16 - The Deliverers (18 scenes)
		`0 16th Story - The Deliverers - This Bible story comes from Judges chapter 1-3; 6-8; 1 Samuel 1-10`
		`1 After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God. They did not obey God's laws, and they did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites from the Promised Land. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of Yahweh, the true God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone decided to follow their own desires.`
		`2 By disobeying God, the Israelites started a pattern that repeated many times. The pattern went like this: the Israelites would disobey God for several years, then God would allow their enemies to defeat them. These enemies would steal things from the Israelites, destroy their property, and kill many of them. Then after Israel's enemies oppressed them for many years, the Israelites would repent of their sin and ask God to rescue them.`
		`3 Each time the Israelites repented, God would rescue them. He did this by providing a deliverer—a person who would fight against their enemies and defeat them. Then there would be peace in the land and the deliverer would rule over them well. God sent many deliverers to rescue the people. God did this again after he allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat the Israelites.`
		`4 The Midianites took all of the Israelites' crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared, they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.`
		`5 There was an Israelite man name Gideon. One day, he was threshing grain in a hidden place so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of Yahweh came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.” `
		`6 Gideon's father had an altar dedicated to an idol. God's first command to Gideon was to tear down that altar. But Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God nearby and made a sacrifice to God on it.`
		`7 The next morning the people saw their altar destroyed, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon's house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “Why are you trying to help your god? If he is a god, let him protect himself!” Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.`
		`8 Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God was really telling him to save Israel.`
		`9 For the first sign, Gideon laid a sheepskin on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the sheepskin and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the sheepskin dry. God did that, too. Because of these two signs, Gideon believed that God really wanted him to save Israel from the Midianites.`
		`10 Then Gideon called for soldiers to come to him, and 32,000 men came. But God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 men, all who were afraid to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.`
		`11 That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and listen to them talk. When you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid to attack them.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about something he had dreamed. The man's friend said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat us, the Midianite army!” When Gideon heard this, he worshiped God.`
		`12 Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a burning torch. They surrounded the camp where the Midianite soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.`
		`13 Then, all of Gideon's soldiers broke their pots at the same moment, suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for Yahweh and for Gideon!”`
		`14 God confused the Midianites so that they started attacking and killing each other. Immediately, Gideon sent messengers to call many other Israelites to come from their homes and help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites' land. God caused 120,000 Midianites to die that day. This is how God saved Israel from the medianites.`
		`15 The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon did not allow them to do this. he asked them for some of the gold rings that they had taken from the Midianites instead. The people gave Gideon a large amount of gold.`
		`16 Then Gideon used the gold to make a special garment like the high priest used to wear. But the people started worshiping it as if it were an idol. So God punished Israel again because they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another deliverer to rescue them.`
		`17 This same thing happened many times: Every time the Israelites would sin, God would punish them, they would repent, and God would send someone to rescue them. Over many years, God sent many deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.`
		`18 Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but he gave them a king just as they had asked.`

		`0 17th Story - God's Covenant with David, A Bible story from: 1 Samuel 10; 15-19; 24; 31; 2 Samuel 5; 7; 11-12`
		`1 Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul was a good king for the first few years that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man who would one day be king in his place.`
		`2 God chose a young Israelite named David and began to prepare him to one day become king after Saul. David was a shepherd from the town of Bethlehem. At different times, David killed both a lion and a bear that attacked his father's sheep while David was watching them. David was a humble and righteous man. He trusted and obeyed God.`
		`3 When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a very good soldier. He was very strong and about three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel. After that, David won many victories over Israel's enemies. David became a great soldier, and he led Israel's army in many battles. The people praised him very much.`
		`4 The people loved David so much that King Saul became jealous of him. Finally Saul wanted to kill him, so David ran away into the wilderness to hide from him and his soldiers. One day when Saul and his soldiers were looking for him, Saul went into a cave. It was the same cave that David was hiding in, but Saul did not see him. David went up very close behind Saul and cut off a piece of his clothing. Later, after Saul left the cave, David shouted to him to look at the cloth he was holding. In this way, Saul knew that David refused to kill him to become king.`
		`5 Some time later, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles, and God helped him defeat Israel's enemies. David conquered the city of Jerusalem and made it his capital city, where he lived and ruled. David was king for 40 years. During this time, Israel became powerful and wealthy.`
		`6 David wanted to build a temple where all the Israelites could worship God and offer him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had made.`
		`7 But there was a prophet named Nathan. God sent him to tell David this: “You have fought in many wars, so you will not build this Temple for me. Your son will build it. But still, I will greatly bless you. One of your descendants will rule as king over my people forever!” The only descendant of David who could rule forever was the Messiah. The Messiah was God's Chosen One who would save the people of the world from their sin.`
		`8 When David heard Nathan's message, he thanked God and praised him. God was honoring him and giving him many blessings. Of course, David did not know when God would do these things. We know now that the Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.`
		`9 David ruled his people justly for many years. He obeyed God faithfully, and God blessed him. However, in his later years, he sinned greatly against God.`
		`10 One day, David looked out from his palace and saw a beautiful woman bathing. He did not know her, but he found out that her name was Bathsheba.`
		`11 Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later, Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.`
		`12 Bathsheba's husband was a man named Uriah. He was one of David's best soldiers. He was away fighting in a war at this time. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed. This is what happened: Uriah died in battle.`
		`13 After Uriah died in the war, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to David's son. What David had done displeased God(2 Samuel 11:27), so he sent the prophet Nathan to tell David how evil his sin was. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David followed and obeyed God, even in difficult times.`
		`14 David made many nations ridicule the name of God, and God punished David for it. David's boy, born from adultery died, and some members of his own family rebelled against him. David lost much power and influence. But God was faithful and fulfilled his promises to David, even though David had disobeyed him. Later, David and Bathsheba had another son, and they named him Solomon.`

Solomon asked that God would give him wisdom to rule the people of Israel. This pleased God, so he made Solomon the wisest man in the world. God also made him very wealthy.`
		`2 In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple which his father David had planned and gathered materials for. People now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to him at the Temple instead of at the Tent of Meeting. God came and was present in the Temple, and he lived there with his people.`
		`3 But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and continued to worship them. When Solomon was old, he also worshiped their gods.`
		`4 God was displeased with Solomon because of his disobedience, and God promised to divide Solomon's kingdom in two after his death.`
		`5 After Solomon died, his son Rehoboam became king. All the people of the nation of Israel came together to accept him as their king. They complained to Rehoboam that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes. They asked Rehoboam to make them work less.`
		`6 But Rehoboam answered them in a very foolish way. He said, “You say that my father, Solomon, made you work hard. But I will make you work harder than he did.`
		`7 When the people heard him say this, most of them rebelled against him. Ten tribes left him; only two tribes remained with him. These two tribes called themselves the kingdom of Judah.`
		`8 The other ten tribes made a man named Jeroboam to be their king. These tribes were in the northern part of the land. They called themselves the kingdom of Israel.`
		`9 Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship. They no longer went to Jerusalem in the kingdom of Judah to worship God at the Temple.`
		`10 The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.`
		`11 In the new kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.`
		`12 All of the kings and most of the people of the kingdom of Israel worshiped idols. When they did this, they often slept with prostitutes and sometimes even sacrificed children to the idols.`
		`13 The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah's kings were evil. They ruled badly, and they worshiped idols. Some of these kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. Most of the people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.`

		`0 19th Story - The Prophets - A Bible story from: 1 Kings 16-18; 2 Kings 5; Jeremiah 38 `
		`1 God was always sending prophets to the Israelites. The prophets heard messages from God and then told them to the people.`
		`2 Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over the kingdom of Israel. Ahab was an evil man. He tried to make the people worship a false god named Baal. So Elijah told King Ahab that God was going to punish the people. He said to him, “There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel until I say it will rain again.” This made Ahab so angry that he decided to kill Elijah.`
		`3 So God told Elijah to go into the wilderness to hide from Ahab. Elijah went into the wilderness to a certain stream where God directed him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring Elijah bread and meat. During this time, Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him.`
		`4 Because there was no rain, after some time the stream dried up. So Elijah went to another country close by. In that country lived a poor widow and her son. They had almost run out of food because there was no harvest. But still, as the woman took care of Elijah, God provided for her and her son. Her jar of flour and her bottle of oil never became empty. They had food during the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for about three years.`
		`5 After three and a half years, God told Elijah that he would make it rain again. He told Elijah to return to the kingdom of Israel and speak with Ahab. So Elijah went to Ahab. When Ahab saw him, he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah replied to him, “It is you who are the troublemaker! You have abandoned Yahweh. He is the true God, but you are worshiping Baal. Now you must bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to Mount Carmel.”`
		`6 So all the people of Israel went to Mount Carmel. The men who said they spoke messages for Baal also came. These were Baal's prophets. There were 450 of them. Elijah said to the people, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yahweh is God, worship him! But if Baal is God, worship him!”`
		`7 Then Elijah said to Baal's prophets, “Kill a bull, divide the meat into pieces, and put it on an altar for a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same later, and I will put the meat on a different altar. Then if God sends fire on the altar, you will know that he is the real God.” So the prophets of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.`
		`8 Then the prophets of Baal prayed to Baal, “Hear us, Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer, and he did not send any fire.`
		`9 Baal's prophets spent almost the whole day praying to Baal. They finally stopped praying. Then Elijah put the meat of another bull on an altar for God. After that, he told the people to pour 12 huge pots of water on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar were completely wet.`
		`10 Then Elijah prayed, “Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that you are the true God.”`
		`11 Immediately, fire fell from the sky. It burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the soil, and even the water that was around the altar. When the people saw this, they prostrated themselves to the ground and said, “Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”`
		`12 Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal and took them away from there and killed them.`
		`13 Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to your home, because the rain is coming.” Soon the sky became black, and a heavy rain began. Yahweh was ending the drought. This also showed that he is the true God.`
		`14 When Elijah finished his work, God chose a man named Elisha to be his prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to Naaman. He was the commander of an enemy army, but he had a bad skin disease. Naaman heard about Elisha, so he went to Elisha and asked him to heal him. Elisha told Naaman to go the Jordan River and dip himself in the water seven times.`
		`15 Naaman became angry. He refused to do this because it seemed foolish. But later he changed his mind. He went to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times into the water. When he came up from the water the last time, God healed him.`
		`16 God also sent many other prophets to the people of Israel. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols. Instead, people should act justly with each other and have mercy on each other. The prophets warned the people that they must stop doing evil and obey God. because God will punish those who do not obey his law.`
		`17 Most of the time, the people did not obey God. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, they put the prophet Jeremiah into a dry well and left him there to die. He sank down into the mud in the bottom of the well. But then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.`
		`18 The prophets continued to speak for God even though the people hated them. The prophets warned of God's punishments, but also of God's promises. That God would send them a Messiah to save them from their cycle of falling into sin and captivity over and over again.`

		`1 The kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah both sinned against God. They broke the covenant that God had made with them at Sinai. God sent his prophets to warn them to repent and worship him again, but they refused to obey.`
		`2 So God punished both kingdoms by allowing their enemies to destroy them. Assyria was another nation that became very powerful. The Assyrians were also very cruel to other nations. They came and destroyed the kingdom of Israel. The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, took away everything they wanted, and burned much of the country.`
		`3 The Assyrians gathered together all the leaders, the rich people, and the people who could make valuable things. They took them to Assyria. Only some very poor Israelites remained in Israel.`
		`4 Then the Assyrians brought foreigners to live in the land. The foreigners rebuilt the cities. They intermarried with the Israelites who were left there. The descendants of these people were called Samaritans.`
		`5 The people in the kingdom of Judah saw how God had punished the people of the kingdom of Israel for not believing and obeying him. But they still worshiped idols, including the gods of the Canaanites. God sent prophets to warn them, but they refused to listen.`
		`6 About 100 years after the Assyrians destroyed the kingdom of Israel, God sent Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Babylonians, to attack the kingdom of Judah. Babylon was a powerful nation. The king of Judah agreed to be Nebuchadnezzar's servant and pay him a lot of money every year.`
		`7 But after a few years, the king of Judah rebelled against Babylon. So, the Babylonians came back and attacked the kingdom of Judah. They captured the city of Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and took away all the treasures of the city and the Temple.`
		`8 To punish the king of Judah for rebelling, Nebuchadnezzar's soldiers killed the king's sons in front of him and then made him blind. After that, they took the king away so he would die in prison in Babylon.`
		`9 Nebuchadnezzar and his army took almost all of the people of the kingdom of Judah to Babylon, leaving only the poorest people behind to plant the fields. This period of time when God's people were forced to leave the Promised Land is called the Exile.`

		`1 Even in the beginning when God created the world, God had planned to send the Messiah in the future. He promised Adam and Eve that a descendant of Eve would be born who would crush the snake's head. Of course, Satan appeared as a snake in order to deceive Eve. God planned that the Messiah will defeat Satan completely.`
		`2 God promised Abraham that through him all people groups of the world would receive a blessing. God would fulfill this promise by sending the Messiah as his descendant. The Messiah would save people from their sin out of every people group in the world. In this way the promised to abraham would be fulfilled.`
		`3 God promised Moses that in the future he would send another prophet like Moses who saved people from slavery in Egypt. The other prophet will be the Messiah that will save people from slavery to sin. In this way, God promised again that he would send the Messiah.`
		`4 God promised King David that one of his own descendants would be the Messiah. He would be king and rule over God's people forever.`
		`5 God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah and told him that he would make a New Covenant one day. The New Covenant would not be like the old covenant God where God's law was written in stone, but it would be written in the hearts of the people. Each person would know God personally, love Him and want to obey his laws. It is the Messiah who would make the New Covenant with them.`
		`6 God's prophets also said that the Messiah would be a prophet, a priest, and a king. A prophet delivers the words of God to the people. The Messiah would be the perfect prophet that hears God's messages perfectly, understand them perfectly, and he would teach them to people perfectly.`
		`7 Israelite priests made sacrifices of perfect animals to die in the place of repentant sinners and prayed to God to forgive them. God requires death as the only recompense for sin, as God will not allow sin to live forever. The Messiah that will come, will be the perfect high priest. He would offer himself as the perfect sacrifice by having never sinned, and animal sacrifice will not be needed again.`
		`8 Kings rule over groups of people, and sometimes they make mistakes. King David ruled over only the Israelites. But the Messiah, a descendant of David, will rule over the whole world, and he will rule forever. Also, he will always rule justly and make the right decisions.`
		`9 God's prophets said many other things about the Messiah. For example, Malachi said that a prophet would come before the Messiah. Isaiah wrote that a prophet wouuld prepare the way for the messiah. The prophet Isaiah also wrote that the Messiah would be born of a virgin. And the prophet Micah said that the Messiah would be born in the town of Bethlehem.`
		`10 The prophet Isaiah said the Messiah would live in the region of Galilee. The Messiah would comfort people who were very sad. He would also set prisoners free. The Messiah would also heal sick people and those who could not hear, see, speak, or walk.`
		`11 The prophet Isaiah also said that people would hate the Messiah and refuse to accept him. Other prophets said that a friend of the Messiah would turn against him. The prophet Zechariah said that this friend would receive 30 silver coins to betray him. Also, some prophets said that people would kill the Messiah, and that they would gamble for his clothes.`
		`12 The prophets also told about how the Messiah would die. Isaiah prophesied that people would spit on, mock, and beat the Messiah. They would pierce him, and he would die in great suffering and agony even though he had not done anything wrong.`
		`13 The prophets also said that the Messiah would not sin. He would be perfect. But he would die to give his life as a recompense for the sins of all sinners. When he died, people would be able to have peace with God. This is why, in God's plan, the Messiah had to die.`
		`14 The prophets also said that God would raise the Messiah from the dead. This shows that Jesus' death and resurrection was all God's plan to confirm the New Covenant. This new covenant will save all the sinners who repent and love Him.`
		`15 God revealed to the prophets many things about the Messiah, but the Messiah did not come during the time of any of those prophets. More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, at exactly the right time, God sent the Messiah into the world.`

		`2 The angel said to Zechariah, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. God will fill him with the Holy Spirit, and John will get the people ready to accept the Messiah!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How can I know you are telling me the truth?”`
		`3 The angel responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah's wife became pregnant from him.`
		`4 When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel suddenly appeared to Elizabeth's relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Son of the Most High God and will rule forever.”`
		`5 Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will rest on you, because the power of God will cover you. The baby will be holy, and he will be the Son of God.” Mary believed what the angel said.`
		`6 Soon after this happened, Mary went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Mary greeted her, Elizabeth's baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.`
		`7 After this, Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy. Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God made Zechariah able to speak again. Zechariah said, “Praise God, because he has remembered to help his people! You, my son, will be the prophet of the Most High God. You will tell the people how they can receive forgiveness for their sins!”`

		`2 The angel said, “Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby that is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins.”`
		`3 So Joseph married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.`
		`4 When the time was near for Mary to give birth, she and Joseph made a long journey to the town of Bethlehem. They had to go there because the Roman officials wanted to count all the people in the land of Israel. They wanted everyone to go to where their ancestors had lived. King David had been born in Bethlehem, and he was the ancestor of both Mary and Joseph.`
		`5 Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem, but there was no place for them to stay in other than an animal shelter. It was there that Mary gave birth to her baby. She laid him in a feeding trough since there was no bed for him. They named him Jesus.`
		`6 That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, “Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!”`
		`7 “Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough.” Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels. They were praising God. They said, “May all honor be to God in heaven. May there be peace on earth to the people he favors!”`
		`8 Then the angels left. The shepherds left their sheep to look for the baby. They soon arrived at the place where Jesus was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. Then the shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were. They were praising God for everything they had heard and seen.`
		`9 There were some men in a country far to the east that were very wise. They studied the stars and saw an unusual star in the sky. They knew this star signified that the king of the Jews had been born. So they decided to travel from their country to see the child.

		`2 Many people came out to the wilderness to listen to John. He preached to them, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of God is near!”`
		`3 When people heard John's message, many of them repented from their sins, and John baptized them. Many religious leaders also came to see John, but they did not repent or confess their sins.`
		`4 John said to the religious leaders, “You poisonous snakes! Repent and change your behavior. God will cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit, and he will throw them into the fire.” John fulfilled what the prophets had said, “See, I will soon send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.”`
		`5 Some religious leaders asked John if he was the Messiah. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but he is coming after me. He is so great that I am not even worthy to untie his sandals.”`
		`6 The next day, Jesus came for John to baptize him. When John saw him, he said, “Look! There is the Lamb of God who will take away the sin of the world.”`
		`7 John said to Jesus, “I am not worthy to baptize you. You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize me, because it is the right thing to do.” So John baptized him even though Jesus had never sinned.`

		`2 Jesus went to the town of Nazareth. This is the village where he had lived when he was a child. On the Sabbath, he went to the place of worship. The leaders handed him a scroll with the messages of the prophet Isaiah. They wanted him to read from it. So Jesus opened up the scroll and read part of it to the people.`

		`1 Jesus told many other stories about the kingdom of God. For example, he said, “The kingdom of God is like a small seed that a man planted in his field."`
		`2 “But when the seed grows, it becomes the largest of all plants in the garden, big enough that even the birds come and rest in its branches.”`
		`3 Telling another story, Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman mixes into some bread dough until it spreads throughout the dough.”`
		`4 “The kingdom of God is also like treasure that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and wanted it very much. So he buried it again. He was so filled with joy that he went and sold everything he had so he could buy that field where the treasure was.”`
		`5 “The kingdom of God is also like a perfect pearl of great value. When a pearl merchant found it, he sold all that he had so he could buy it.”`
		`6 There were some people who thought God would accept them because they were doing good things. These people despised others who did not do those good things. So Jesus told them this story: “There were two men, both of whom went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector who worked for the government that oppressed the people of Israel. Tax collectors were considered traitors and enemies of God by the people of Israel, and the other was a religious leader admired by the people of Israel.”`
		`7 “The religious leader prayed like this, 'Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector over there.'”`
		`8 “'For example, I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of all the money and goods that I receive.'”`
		`9 “But the tax collector stood far away from the religious leader. He did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest with his fist and prayed, 'God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.'”`
		`10 Then Jesus said, “I tell you, God heard the tax collector's prayer, and declared him to be righteous rather than the religious leader. God will dishonor everyone who is proud, but he will honor whoever humbles himself.”`

He knew that the Jewish leaders did not accept that Jesus was the Messiah. He knew that they wanted to kill him.`

This symbolizes my body, which I will give for you. Do this to remember me.” In this way, Jesus said that he would die for them, that he would sacrifice his body for them.`

		`6 Then Jesus said to the disciples, “One of you will betray me.” The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread is the betrayer.” Then he gave the bread to Judas.`
		`7 After Judas took the bread, Judas allowed Satan to enter into him. Judas left and went to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus on that very night.`

		`3 Finally, the high priest looked directly at Jesus and said, “Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of the living God?”`
		`4 Jesus said, “I am, and you will see me seated with God and coming from heaven.” The high priest tore his clothes because he was angry at what Jesus said. He shouted to the other leaders, “We do not need any more witnesses to tell us what this man has done! You yourselves have heard him say that he is the Son of God. What is your decision about him?”`

They said, “We heard Stephen speak evil things about Moses and God!” So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the high priest and the other leaders of the Jews. More false witnesses came and lied to them about Stephen.`
		`3 The high priest asked Stephen, “Are these men telling the truth about you?” Stephen said “You people are stubborn and rebellious against God. You constantly reject the Holy Spirit, just as our ancestors constantly rejected God and killed his prophets. But you did something worse. You killed the Messiah!” And the people were deeply convicted in their hearts, but became angry.`
		`4 Stephen then received a vision from the Holy Spirit, and said "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God." When the religious leaders heard this, they were so angry that they covered their ears and yelled loudly. They dragged Stephen out of the city and threw stones at him in order to kill him.`
		`5 As Stephen was dying, he cried out, “Jesus, receive my spirit. and do not hold this sin against them.” Then he died.`
		`6 That day many people in Jerusalem started persecuting the followers of Jesus, so those who beleived in Jesus fled to other places, and they preached about Jesus everywhere they went.`
		`7 There was a believer in Jesus named Philip. He fled from Jerusalem, as did most other believers. He went to the region of Samaria where he preached to people about Jesus. Many people believed him and were saved. One day, an angel came from God to Philip and told him to go into the dessert, and to walk down a certain road. Philip went there. As he was walking on the road, he saw a man riding in his chariot. This man was an important official from the land of Ethiopia. The Holy Spirit told Philip to go and talk with this man.`
		`8 So Philip went to the chariot. He heard the Ethiopian reading God's word. He was reading what the prophet Isaiah had written. The man read, “They led him like a lamb to be killed, and as a lamb is silent, he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect him. They took his life away from him.”`
		`9 Philip asked the Ethiopian, “Do you understand what you are reading?” The Ethiopian replied, “No. I cannot understand it unless someone explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. Was Isaiah writing about himself or someone else?”`
		`10 Philip got into the chariot and sat down. Then he told the Ethiopian man that Isaiah had written about Jesus. Philip also spoke of the other prophets that also predicted that Jesus would die to save us from our sins. In this way, he told the man the good news about Jesus.`
		`11 As Philip and the Ethiopian traveled, they came to some water. The Ethiopian said, “Look! There is some water! May I be baptized?” And he told the driver to stop the chariot.`
		`12 So they went down into the water, and Philip baptized the Ethiopian. After they came up out of the water, the Holy Spirit suddenly carried Philip away to another place. There Philip continued to tell people about Jesus.`
		`13 The Ethiopian continued traveling toward his home. With the good news that Jesus is the Messiah that saves us from our sins.`

		`0 46th story: Saul Becomes a Follower of Jesus. A Bible story from: Acts 8:1-3; 9:1-31; 11:19-26; 13-14`
		`1 There was a man named Saul who did not believe in Jesus. When he was a young man, he guarded the robes of the men who killed Stephen. Later he persecuted the believers. He went from house to house in Jerusalem to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison. Then the high priest gave Saul permission to go to the city of Damascus. He told Saul to arrest followers of Jesus there and to bring them back to Jerusalem.`
		`2 So Saul began to travel to Damascus. Just before he reached the city, a bright light in the sky shone all around him, and he fell to the ground. Saul heard someone say, “Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?” Saul asked, “Who are you, Master?” Jesus replied to him, “I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting!”`
		`3 When Saul got up, he could not see. His friends had to lead him into Damascus. Saul did not eat or drink anything for three days.`
		`4 There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. God said to him, “Go to the house where Saul is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again.” But Ananias said, “Master, I have heard how this man has persecuted the believers.” God answered him, “Go! I have chosen him to declare my name to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will suffer many things for my name.”`
		`5 So Ananias went to Saul, placed his hands on him, and said, “Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can see again, and so the Holy Spirit will fill you.” Immediately Saul was able to see again, and Ananias baptized him. Then Saul ate some food and became strong again.`
		`6 Right away Saul began preaching to the Jews in Damascus. He said, “Jesus is the Son of God!” The Jews were amazed because Saul had tried to kill believers, and now he believed in Jesus! Saul argued with the Jews. He showed that Jesus was the Messiah.`
		`7 After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Saul. They sent people to watch for him at the city gates in order to kill him. But Saul heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall in a basket. After Saul escaped from Damascus, he continued to preach about Jesus.`
		`8 Saul went to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles, but they were afraid of him. Then a believer named Barnabas took Saul to the apostles. He told them how Saul had preached boldly in Damascus. After that the apostles accepted Saul.`
		`9 Some believers who fled persecution in Jerusalem went far to the city of Antioch and preached about Jesus. Most of the people in Antioch were not Jews, but for the first time, people who were not Jews became believers. Barnabas and Saul went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to strengthen the church. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called 'Christians.'`
		`10 One day, the followers of Jesus at Antioch were fasting and praying. The Holy Spirit said to them, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do.” So the church in Antioch prayed for Barnabas and Saul and placed their hands on them. Then they sent them out to preach the good news about Jesus in many other places. Barnabas and Saul taught people in different people groups, and many people believed in Jesus.`

		`0 47th story: Paul and Silas in Philippi. A Bible story from: Acts 16:11-40`
		`1 As Saul traveled throughout the Roman Empire, he began to use his Roman name, 'Paul.' One day, Paul and his friend Silas went to the town of Philippi to proclaim the good news about Jesus. They went to a place by the river outside the city where people gathered to pray. There they met a woman named Lydia who was a merchant. She loved and worshiped God.`
		`2 Lydia believed the gospel about Jesus. Paul and Silas baptized her and her family. She invited Paul and Silas to stay at her house, so they stayed there.`
		`3 Paul and Silas often met with people at the place where Jews prayed. Every day as they walked there, a slave girl possessed by a demon followed them. By means of this demon, she predicted the future for people, so she made a lot of money for her masters as a fortuneteller.`
		`4 The slave girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They are telling you the way to be saved!” She did this so often that Paul became annoyed.`
		`5 Finally, one day when the slave girl started yelling, Paul turned to her and said to the demon that was in her, “In the name of Jesus, come out of her.” Right away the demon left her.`
		`6 The men who owned the slave girl became very angry! They realized that, without the demon, the slave girl could not tell people the future. This meant that people would no longer pay her owners to have her tell their future.`
		`7 So the owners of the slave girl took Paul and Silas to the Roman authorities, who beat Paul and Silas, and then threw them into jail.`
		`8 They put Paul and Silas with many guards. They even tied them to large pieces of wood. But in the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were singing songs of praise to God.`
		`9 Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake! All the prison doors opened wide, and the chains of all the prisoners fell off.`
		`10 Then the jailer woke up. He saw that the prison doors were open. He thought that all the prisoners had escaped. He was afraid the Roman authorities would kill him for allowing them to go, so he got ready to kill himself! But Paul saw him and shouted, “Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here.”`
		`11 The jailer trembled as he came to Paul and Silas and asked, “What must I do to be saved?” Paul answered, “Believe in Jesus, the Master, and you and your family will be saved.” Then the jailer took Paul and Silas into his home and washed their wounds. Paul preached the good news about Jesus to everyone in his house.`
		`12 The jailer and his whole family believed in Jesus, so Paul and Silas baptized them. Then the jailer gave Paul and Silas a meal, and they rejoiced together.`
		`13 The next day the leaders of the city released Paul and Silas from prison and asked them to leave Philippi. Paul and Silas visited Lydia and some other friends and then left the city. The good news about Jesus kept spreading, and the Church kept growing.`
		`14 Paul and other leaders of the believers traveled to many cities. They preached and taught people the good news about Jesus. They also wrote many letters to encourage and teach the believers in the churches. Some of these letters became books of the Bible.`

		`1 When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no sickness or death. This was the way God wanted the world to be.`
		`2 Satan spoke to Eve in the garden through the snake because he wanted to deceive her. Then she and Adam obeyed the serpent and dissobeyed God, and in that way sinned against God. Because they sinned, they and their descendants could not eat of the tree of life and live forever.`
		`3 Because Adam and Eve sinned, something even worse happened. They became afraid of God, and hid from him. Every person sins from birth, and is an enemy of God from birth. There was no peace between people and God. But God wanted to make peace.`
		`4 God promised that one of Eve's descendants would crush Satan's head, and Satan would bite his heel. This was the first promise of the Messiah. Satan would try to destroy the Messiah but it would not work, because God will raise him from the dead. But the Messiah would eventually destroy Satan forever. Many years later, God showed that the Messiah is Jesus.`
		`5 God sent a flood to destroy all the wicked people of the world, but God told Noah to build a boat to save all who would enter. All who believed God entered the boat, and God saved them. This boat was a symbol of the Messiah. God will clean the world from sin and sinners in the end of time, but all who repent and believe in Jesus will be saved.`
		`6 For hundreds of years, priests offered sacrifices to God and asked God for the forgiveness of sins of the people. This showed that death is required for our sins, and that only an sinless animal could take our place. This was also a symbol of the Messiah. Jesus lived a sinless life, and gave himself as the sinless sacrifice. He died to pay the price for our sins, and lives to ask the Father for our forgiveness For this reason, Jesus is the lamb and the Great High Priest.`
		`7 God had told Abraham, “I will bless all the people groups on the earth through you.” Jesus was a descendant of this Abraham. All who believe in Jesus will be blessed. They will enter heaven and have eternal life, and they will receive the promises made to Abraham and his descendants.`
		`8 God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his own son, Isaac to Him. Abraham obeyed God and almost sacrificed his son, but at the last second, God stopped him and provided a ram to die in the place of Isaac. God taught abraham that he will sacrifice his own Son, so that Abraham's descendants will live. That is why we call Jesus the Lamb of God.`
		`9 When God sent the last plague on Egypt, he told each Israelite family to kill a lamb. The lamb must not have any flaws. Then they had to spread its blood on their door frames. An angel would go and destroy every firstborn son, but it would passover those homes on which there was blood on their door frames. When this happened, God called this the Passover.`
		`10 The passover lamb was a symbol of Jesus. He was killed at the time of the Passover festival. Jesus never sinned, just as the lamb that had no flaws. To all who believe in Jesus, death will pass over them and will obtain eternal life . `
		`11 God made a covenant with the Israelites, but they refused to be obedient, and share salvation with people of other nations. God then made the New Covenant accessible to every nation through Jesus' death. The symbols that the Israelites kept secret and away from other nations were fulfilled in Jesus and made known to all nations. If anyone in any people group believes in Jesus, they become God's people and will be saved.`
		`12 Moses was a prophet who proclaimed the word of God with great power. But Jesus is the greatest prophet of all. He is God, so all the things he did and said were from God. That is why the Scriptures call Jesus the Word of God.`
		`13 God promised King David that one of his descendants would rule as king over God's people forever. Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah. He is the descendant of David who will rule forever.`

		`1 An angel told Mary, a young woman, that she would give birth to God's Son. She was still a virgin, but the Holy Spirit made her become pregnant. She gave birth to a son and named him Jesus. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.`
		`2 Jesus did many miracles that show that he is God. He walked on water and stopped storms. He healed many sick people and drove demons out other people. He raised dead people to life, and he turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough food to feed over 5,000 people.`
		`3 Jesus was also a great teacher. Everything he taught, he taught correctly. People should do what he commanded because he is the Son of God. For example, he taught us to love other people as we love ourselves.`
		`4 He also taught that you need to love God more than anything or anyone else.`
		`5 Jesus said that it is better to be in God's kingdom than to own the whole world. God must save us from our sins in order for us to enter his holy kingdom.`
		`6 Jesus said that some people will not accept him. However, other people will accept him. The gospel of Jesus is like a seed. Jesus said that the people who accept him are like good soil, because they hear the gospel of Jesus, and God saves them from sin and are made holy. However, the other people are like the hard soil on a path. They hear the gospel, but they have no desire to change. These people reject the message of Jesus and they refuse to enter into God's kingdom.`
		`7 Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He wants to forgive them and to make them his children.`
		`8 Jesus also told us that God hates sin because it causes pain and suffering to God and His creatures that He loves. When Adam and Eve sinned, all of their descendants would also be born inclined to sin. Every person in the world has sinned and is born with enmity against God and others. Therefore no one is trustworthy of eternal life.`
		`9 But God still loved everyone in the world so that he gave his only Son to take the place of those who repent from sin and accept Jesus as their savior. Then, those who believe and repent can live with him forever.`
		`10 We deserve to die because we have sinned. It would be just for us to die, but Jesus died in our place instead. He demonstrated God's great love, by dying on the cross.`
		`11 Jesus never sinned. He accepted the punishment for sin, including the most shameful death possible. Those who died on a cross were called "cursed of God." The son of God, became "cursed of God" so that the best and worst of sinners that repent and believe in Him could be called "Sons of God."`
		`12 Even if you do many good deeds, it cannot make you deserve eternal life. Every sin must be paid for by death. God will not allow sin and sinners to live forever because God is good, and sin is not. All people deserve to die, but if you repent of your sins, believe that Jesus died for your sins, and confess your sins to Him. God will consider your sin paid-for by Christ's death. Then, just as God resurrected Jesus from the dead, he will resurrect you and give you eternal life.`
		`13 God will save everyone who repents of sin, and believes in Jesus. But He will not save those who do not repent from sin. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you live. God loves you and wants you to repent and believe in Jesus so that you can live with him forever.`
		`14 Jesus is calling you to believe in him and to be baptized. Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and that you deserve death for your sin? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take your place and wash away your sins?`
		`15 If you repent of your sins, and believe in Jesus and proclaim what he has done for you, you are a follower of Jesus! Satan no longer rules over you. God is now the ruler of your life. God will enable you to no longer sin as you used to do. He has given you a new, and right way of living.`
		`16 If you are a follower of Jesus, God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did. You no longer need to see God as your enemy. God considers you to be a close friend and a son instead of an enemy.`
		`17 As a friend of God and a servant of Jesus, you will want to obey what Jesus teaches. Satan will still tempt you to sin and disobey Jesus, but God will give you strength to continue fighting and overcome sin. If we do fall into sin, He promises that if you repent from your sin and confess to Him, He will forgive you. God always fulfills his promises.`

		`1 For almost 2,000 years, more and more people around the world have been hearing the good news about Jesus the Messiah. The Church has been growing. Jesus promised he would return at the end of the world. Though he has not yet come back, he will keep his promise.`
		`2 As we wait for Jesus to return, God wants us to live in a way that is holy and that honors him. He also wants us to tell others about his kingdom. When Jesus was living on earth, he said, “My disciples will preach the good news about the kingdom of God to people everywhere in the world, and then the end will come.”`
		`3 Many people groups still have not heard about Jesus. Before he returned to heaven, Jesus told his followers to proclaim the good news to people who have never heard it. He said, “Go and make disciples in all people groups!” and “The fields are ripe for harvest!”`
		`4 Jesus also said, “A man's servant is not greater than his master. The important people in this world have hated me, and they will also torture you and kill you because of me. In this world you will suffer, but be strong, because I have defeated Satan, the one who rules this world. If you remain faithful to me to the end, then God will save you!”`
		`5 Jesus told his disciples a story to explain what will happen to people when the world ends. He said, “A man planted good seed in his field. While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted grass seeds among the wheat seeds, and then he went away.”`
		`6 “When the plants sprouted, the servants of the man said, 'Master, you planted good seed in that field. So why is there grass in it?' The man answered, 'Only an enemy could have done this.'”`
		`7 “The servants responded to their master, 'Should we pull out the grass?' The master said, 'No. If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well. Wait until the harvest. Then gather the grass into piles so you can burn it. But bring the wheat into my barn.'”`
		`8 The disciples did not understand the meaning of the story, so they asked Jesus to explain it to them. Jesus said, “The man who planted the good seed represents the Messiah. The field represents the world. The good seed represents the people of God's kingdom.”`
		`9 “The grass represent the people who belong to the devil, the evil one. The man's enemy, the one who planted the grass, represents the devil. The harvest represents the end of the world, and the harvesters represent God's angels.”`
		`10 “When the world ends, the angels will gather together all the people who belong to the devil. The angels will throw them into a very hot fire to burn up like grass. But the people who are righteous, who have followed Jesus, will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God their Father. ”`
		`11 Jesus also said that he would return to earth just before the world ends. He will come back the same way that he left. That is, he will have a real body, and he will come on the clouds in the sky. When Jesus returns, every follower of Jesus who has died will rise from the dead and meet him in the sky.`
		`12 Then the followers of Jesus who are still alive will rise up into the sky and join with the other followers of Jesus who rose from the dead. They will all be with Jesus there. After that, Jesus will live with his people. They will have complete peace forever as they live together.`
		`13 Jesus promised to give a crown to everyone who believes in him. They will rule with God over everything forever. They will have perfect peace.`
		`14 But God will destroy everyone who did not repent of living in sin and and those who rejected eternal life by not believing the words of Jesus. He will throw them into fire to be destroyed forever. There they will suffer according to their works.`
		`15 When Jesus returns, he will destroy Satan and his kingdom. He will throw Satan into the fire. Satan will burn there, along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than to obey God. The sin and sinners who caused anguish and pain for thousands of years will now come to an end forever`
		`16 Because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and brought sin into this world the earth was corrupted. So God will destroy the old earth and create a new earth that will be holy and perfect as God created in the beginning.`
		`17 Jesus and his people will live on the new earth, and he will reign forever over everything. He will wipe away every tear from people's eyes. No one will suffer or be sad any longer. They will not cry. They will not be sick or die. And there will be nothing evil there. Jesus will rule the universe with peace. He will be with his people forever.`
